      <h2 id="aims">Aims</h2>
      <h2 id="plans">Plans & Progress</h2>
      <p>The Drive Aware project started off as the Assignment 1 project Idea of Matthew Wotton: one of our team members.  The original concept was to develop an application for a wearable device, the Apple Watch, and for the iPhone that would monitor drivers and alert them to signs of fatigue (Wotton 2021).  This is a widely recognised problem for truck drivers, they work long hours which leads to exhaustion <a href="https://www.cannonlogistics.com.au/blog/fatigue-management-truck-drivers-need-know/"> (Fatigue Management: What Truck Drivers Need To Know) [07/05/21]</a>  in turn creating a hazardous environment for other road users. <a href="https://www.bitre.gov.au/publications/ongoing/fatal_heavy_vehicle_crashes_quarterly ">(Fatal Heavy Vehicle Crashes Australia—Quarterly Bulletins) [07/05/21] </a> Our group quickly became fond of polls as a way of coming to decisions and after a look at all the group’s Assignment 1 projects, Nicole organised a poll to decide which one we would like to work on together with Matthew’s coming out on top.</p>
<p>As commenced our research in Assignment 2, we received some valuable constructive criticism from Daniel, Waymo’s System Engineering Manager <a href="https://s3903477.github.io/ITT-Assignment-2/Interview.html">(Josevski 2021).  (Interviewing an IT Professional) [07/05/21] </a> Gerard conducted a literature review of scholarly articles relating to driver fatigue as well as the physiology and measurement of stages of the onset of sleep which concluded with recommendations on which biometrics may be worth measuring and why (See artifacts).  This was re-enforced by research subsequently undertaken by Liljana (Samson, 2021).<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.23541"> (Taking the sleep lab to the field: Biometric techniques for quantifying sleep and circadian rhythms in humans, David R. Samson) [07/05/21] </a>
</p>
<p>After a team discussion, we decided our aim for the user market would be any vehicle driver, including professionals and everyday commuters. <a href="https://www.optalert.com/driver-fatigue-why-does-driving-make-you-tired/"> ( Driver fatigue: why does driving make you tired?) [07/05/21] ) </a> We also decided on, to begin with at least, having the application accessible on an iPhone in conjunction with an Apple Watch <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/watch/apd99e3c6a68/watchos"> (Apple Watch User Guide) [07/05/21] </a> and in the future consider further developing it on Android with a corresponding smart watch. This would not restrict the user market in the long term and issues would be identified on a single platform rather than needing to alter its construction to accommodate both Android and iOS.  Additionally, we believe that starting with Apple for our prototype will be simpler as two of our team members have Apple Watches and understand their use and functionality. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/guide/watch/apd99e3c6a68/watchos">(Apple Watch User Guide) [07/05/21] </a></p>
  
<br>
<h3>The Drive Aware App Plan  </h3>
<h4>Hand drawn flow chart drafts. </h4>
<img src="assets/handdrawnflow.png" alt="hand drawn flow charts">
<br>
<p>We started off with a hand drawn sketch outlining basic functionality, indicating how the app should look when opened including pop ups allowing the accessibility of data gathered from the Health App and available on the iPhone. After some discussion and research, we decided that this should then be followed by a prototype developed with Figma.<a href="https://www.figma.com/"> (Minds meeting minds is how great ideas meet the world) [07/05/21] </a> The prototype will allow us to show our vision and enable us to present the idea to others. </p>
<p>The group believe that the components needed for the application’s operation should be easily accessible wearable smart technology and, initially at least, devices that the user currently owns. This enables the app to be interchanged to any vehicle as the equipment needed is neither cumbersome or inbuilt. This enables mobility and flexibility, also affordability compared to some similar technologies currently available offering driver monitoring such as Seeing Machines <a href="https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/213919/seeing-machines-sees-bright-future-for-driver-monitoring-technology-213919.html"> (Seeing Machines sees bright future for driver monitoring technology) [07/05/21] </a></p>
<h4>Flow charts created by team members are below. (See more in Artefacts)</h4>
<img src="assets/otherflowcharts.png" alt="more flow charts from group members">
<p>The images above show the multiple rough drafts show the progress of the flow of the prototype before we started using<a href="https://www.figma.com/"> Figma</a>. Among other things, we had inspiration for the visual aspects of the activity of the biometrics, from looking at the health app on one of our iPhones. This inspired us to display daily statistics and have a line graph showing the length of the drive with the biometric levels.  This information can also be displayed as weekly statistics showing a comparison of the wakefulness throughout the week. Once the app has the user details and you are logged in, we have decided to add an extra screen for users to agree to the<a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/5-reasons-need-terms-conditions/"> terms and conditions</a>. This was a result of assessing the risks associated with the application’s use as well as to limit liability (see Risks).  Should user not agree to the terms: Drive Aware will not be available to assist them. After this, when the user presses start, the screen will go back to the user’s normal home screen and will have an indicator icon showing that the app is operating, this has been designed this way to minimise driver distraction. Another example of a function operating this way is the “personal hotspot” which, when one clicks on the menu section. The Data history will be stored in the app and will use the current technology used with the health app to gather and translate the user’s data. In the set-up stage of the Drive Aware App, the user will need to allow access to the <a href="https://www.apple.com › au › ios › health"> Health App</a> which will also allow access to the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207021"> Medical ID </a>  which consists of the biometrics and emergency contacts. </p>
<h4>Inspiration from the Health App </h4>
<br>
<img src="assets/inspofromhealth.png" alt="inspo from health app">
<br>
<br>
<p>The group proposes to use a similar technology to the facial recognition technology currently in smart phones such as the wire frame to determine the user’s facial distinctions. <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208108"> (About Face ID advanced technology) [07/05/21]</a> This will also allow the app to perceive the eyes as they appear when opened, to then be able to monitor the drivers eye movements when the app is in use and to enable warnings when there is a detection of fatigue occurring. This will also be in the initial use of the app in the set-up stage of the Drive Aware App, the user will need to allow access to the Health App which includes access to Medical ID including biometrics and emergency contacts. </p>
<br>
<h4>The Reaction Test Game</h4>
<br>
<p>The reaction test game was proposed as a solution to the problems caused by drivers lack of insight into their own fatigue levels (Ting et al. 2008).  The original game involved colour selection time to ascertain reaction time (see image below). After some thought we have considered that we would run into some obstacles with the reaction test Game. We thought by changing it from the assorted colours on the pallet we initially had in A2, to something more shape based as the colour palette are too similar to one another and might confuse some users if they cannot identify the correct shade stated. It would especially not work well for colour blind people. <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/eye-health/what-do-colorblind-people-see#:~:text=Color%20blindness%20is%20usually%20an,differentiate%20among%20shades%20of%20colors.&text=Research%20suggests%20that%20color%20blindness,yellow%2C%20and%20complete%20color%20blindness."> (What Do Colour blind People See?) [07/05/21]  </a>
    So, the game we thought of starting with, to get an idea of a reaction time assessment to measure the fatigue level of the driver, was a considerably basic concept. You will be asked to click the left or right arrow when prompted. The questions will repeat three times and if the test is failed by the driver, then they will be required to rest for a further 15 mins with a timer being activated and followed by a retest of the game. 
    </p>
    <img src="assets/reactiongame.png" alt="game concept images">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>We will reconsider the contents of the game and make it more complex as the app progresses to future developments, but we have agreed for the prototype to operate in this way for now. We decided to steer away from the colour palate option and use arrows for our prototype and we can reassess having a simulator or something along those lines for future developments, to assess the alertness of the driver. </p>
<h4>Some ideas we considered for the UI before we completed our prototype. </h4>

  </li>
  </ol>
  <p> <a href="https://www.figma.com"> Figma templates [07/05/21]</a></p>
<br>
<p>The application will run in the background on the device once it has been activated and then will continue to operate through the smart watch measuring the biometrics <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.23541">  (Taking the sleep lab to the field: Biometric techniques for quantifying sleep and circadian rhythms in humans, David R. Samson) [07/05/21] </a> preventing the iPhone or Apple watch to be of a distraction to the driver. We thought of having a coloured indicator, green as an example, at the top of the screen indicating that the app is in fact operating and not a distraction. The iPhone should be securely mounted on the dashboard in sight of the driver’s eyes to enable the forward-facing camera function to detect the eye movements. It will monitor the length of time you have closed your eyes, for example, a blink. This can indicate whether your eyes are becoming tired. Having an extended blink can indicate fatigue and in turn have hazardous effects, therefore predicting sleep. This is also recommended by Vic Roads <a href="https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/safety-and-road-rules/driver-safety/mobile-phones-and-driving">(Mobile phones, technology & driving, 19 April 2021) [06/05/21] </a> that all driver’s aids should be secured and not touched while driving. The device is recommended to be plugged into an appropriate input for charging to suit the device, as the battery should be obtained to continue to operate.<a href="https://www.apple.com/au/shop/iphone/accessories/power-cables?fh=458e%2B45d4:"> (Power & Cables) [07/05/21]</a> The front facing camera will also monitor other fatigue cues such as yawning or dropping of the head. </p>
<p>The accelerometer and gyroscope will also be able to determine whether the driver is becoming tired by comparing the normal movements of a person when they are awake and will be able to predict that their reduced movements which may indicate that they are fatigued and if sleep is imminent. <a href="https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm/sleep-drive-and-your-body-clock#:~:text=Because%20of%20our%20circadian%20rhythm,that%20can%20occur%20after%20lunchtime."> (Sleep Drive and Circadian Rhythm) [07/05/21] </a>This will set the alarm and the driver should vocally deactivate the alarm by saying, “Hey Siri, Stop the Alarm”. Following the deactivation, the driver will be advised to make a stop where safe to do so and perform a short game to signify whether they are alert enough to then resume driving. The functions of the app that will be monitoring the biometrics through the Apple Watch, including heart rate, which slows down when we relax, and in turn can indicate the onset of sleep. <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/how-does-sleep-affect-your-heart-rate-2021012921846"> (How does sleep affect your heart rate? POSTED JANUARY 29, 2021) [07/05/21] )</a>.  It also monitors hand and arm movements indicating a relaxed driver so, therefore, can also predict drowsiness.  The gyroscope can also predict the amount of time the user has been awake and so this together with the app can have a good evaluation of the fatigue level of the driver. If the user has been driving for a prolonged period, the app will alarm to have a rest after 2 hours as a precaution.<a href="https://www.tmr.qld.gov.au/Safety/Driver-guide/Driving-safely/Driving-tired.aspx#:~:text=take%20regular%20breaks%20%E2%80%93%20you%20should,spots%20and%20driver%20reviver%20stops">  Driving tired [17/05/21]</a>
</p>
<p>The phone’s internal camera, along with the gyroscope, accelerometer, and the Apple watches heart rate monitor, will all work together and gather the data to best predict a few different scenarios. The drivers journey exceeding the time limit of 2 hours, may have potential collision and biometrics to predict Fatigue cues. All these factors will then issue a warning in the form of an alarm. If the alarm is not verbally deactivated, <a href="https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/safety-and-road-rules/driver-safety/mobile-phones-and-driving"> (Mobile phones, technology & driving, 19 April 2021) [06/05/21] </a> the emergency contact and emergency services will be notified of a potential collision. If the driver does deactivate the alarm, Drive Aware will prompt the driver to stop the vehicle. Then the Drive Aware app will suggest conducting the reaction test game to measure the attention and concentration level of the driver by the speed of the reaction to the questions stated. It will require a fast response to the questions stated, and if the test is failed, it would require another 15-minute break and a repeat of the test, to determine if the driver is alert enough to then resume driving.</p>
<p>Further developments we have discussed to predict fatigue while driving is an <a href="https://www.neeuro.com/senzeband/"> EEG monitoring </a> device applied to the driver’s head, in the form of a headband. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO-iUU8PIcE"> (Neuroscience - Sleep Cycle EEG, Jul 18, 2016) [06/05/21] </a> This could promote more of an accurate reading in measuring a warning to the driver entering fatigue. It was suggested that not all smart phone users have smart watches but would still benefit from the accessibility and affordability of using this app compared to the inbuilt technology stated previously in assignment 2 from “<a href="https://www.seeingmachines.com/"> Seeing Machines</a>” as an example. So, we believe that the small costs associated in purchasing these wearables to help determine a driver’s alertness is justified, to create safer roads for the people we love. Though, in Assignment 2 we briefly touched on the EEG wearable bands for driver monitoring, but for Assignment 3 we believe to obtain a working prototype and linking it with the EEG band would be better left for future development. These EEG bands are highly feasible for the future production but are currently out of our time scope. Gerard, a member of the DAT Team, contacted a company as they were looking for collaborations and had a meeting discussing the potential future of the Drive Aware app collaboration with them. The EEG band would assist in detecting fatigue levels by discovering whether the brain waves emitted are either Beta waves or Alpha waves.  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2017294"> Neuronal Mechanisms for Sleep/Wake Regulation and Modulatory Drive, Published: 05 December 2017, [03/05/21] </a> 
    The Beta brain waves occur when a person is awake and alert. The Alpha brain waves occur when the person is awake but in a very relaxed state and falling asleep. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycQ3DL5TX9U">  EEG Waveforms Building Blocks of Sleep Staging</a>
     We hope to be able to prevent any collision before it gets to the following stage of Theta brain waves which is the first stage of sleep as shown on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5DUPLI580g"> image below</a> to the left. An example of the wearable <a href="https://www.neeuro.com/senzeband/"> EEG head device</a> is to the right. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMizSSOej0"> (Introduction to EEG, Aug 26, 2014) [06/05/21] </a>
    </p>
    <img src="assets/eeghead.png" alt="EEG head wear from neeuro image">
    <p>There are some elements that could go wrong, such as, if the driver disobeys the apps recommendations of driving after a failed test, then this could potentially cause a collision. The user of the app should choose to apply all the rules to help keep them safe willingly and not go against the recommended usage, as it could cause serious or fatal collision as trucks in specific are exceptionally large and heavy, taking up a lot of space on our roads. In saying this, we decided it was necessary for the app to have terms and conditions. So once the user opens the App and logs in, the user should agree to the terms and conditions in obeying the recommended instructions of the Drive Aware app, to then be able to proceed with its functioning. </p>
    <p>This app is also appropriate for usage of a daily commuter driving to and from work, late nights, or early mornings, when we are most tired which is shown through our Circadian rhythm. <a href="https://www.news-medical.net/health/Circadian-Rhythm.aspx"> What is the Circadian Rhythm? [Y. Smith]</a> <a href="https://laylasleep.com/what-is-circadian-rhythm/">  What is Circadian Rhythm (And Why Your Circadian Clock is Important)[Layla] </a> <a href="https://www.saltwire.com/newfoundland-labrador/wheels/circadian-rhythm-plays-vital-role-in-driving-245554/"> Circadian rhythm plays vital role in driving 
        Richard Russell </a> The drive can become relaxed and if there is no stimulus the driver can become drowsy and in turn cause fatal consequences. 
        </p>
        <img src="assets/circadiumrhytjhem.jpg" alt="circadian rhythem chart">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It is well established that as a driver becomes relaxed during monotonous driving and when there is no stimulus the driver will become drowsy which can have fatal consequences(Fisher et al. 2011). Because of this, another potential user of Drive Aware may be holiday makers on long road trips with their families, especially now with covid 19 putting severe restrictions on overseas travel <a href="https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/leaving-australia">  (COVID-19 and the border Leaving Australia) [07/05/21] </a>This has allowed families to travel more within our country and even using caravans more, <a href="https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/safety-and-road-rules/vehicle-safety/safe-caravanning"> (Safe caravanning) [07/05/21]</a> which are large and can be dangerous if the driver is not fully alert. Sadly, these situations are possible and can have severe consequences so, the drive aware app would be beneficial to these drivers too, and not just the professional driver. </p>
        <p>Having started with the hand drawn sketch and progressing more into the functionality of the app, we considered the app operating with just the iPhone monitoring the eyes and head movements alone in the case that the user does not own an Apple Watch. Of course, this will not be as accurate, but the driver may still benefit from some of the app’s functions. While using the app in this way is not optimal, it will still give some readings and data will be taken to deliver some results for driver monitoring. The flow chart below is from Assignment 2 showing how we believed the app would function. </p>
